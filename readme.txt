This is my Facial Recognition with live attendance Project

In this project the facial recognition model takes an list of images in the images folder, once it gets the set of images it encodes them using the dlib library of c++

Then we call for the camera of the system which identifies the predefined images and writes its name and the data & time of the face captured in an .csv file
Namely Attendance.csv
